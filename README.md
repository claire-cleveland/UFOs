Module 11 DU Data Boot Camp

Overview of the analysis:

This assignment was to create a searchable table on a webpage so end users can find information they're looking for. 

Results:

The search function is easy for users -- they type in certain perameters into the search boxes, including city, country or shape. Then the table pulls up rows with matching information.

Summary:

One drawback of this website is that it's not easy for someone searching the database to compare and contrast the entries. So they can search and then read about the entries that match their search, but they can't save those search results. 

I would reccomend making a comparison button so that certain entries can be clicked or marked and then compared to other entries with different search results. The website and database would also be enhanced by images for each entry, if they exist.
